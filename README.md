### Hi there 👋

#### I'm a Backend Developer working remotely and currently living in Finland.

##### BIO

- ⚙️ I use daily: `Java`, `Sql`, `Scala`, `TypeScript`. Also very happy with `Kotlin` and `Spring`!
- 🌍 I'm always up for new software projects, say [Chess](https://github.com/otson/Chess) or a [sandbox](https://github.com/otson/Voxels) to play in!
- 🌱 One algorithm problem a day to stay sharp.
- ⚡️ Dabbling in Angular and TypeScript lately, expanding my horizons. 
- 💬 I speak Finnish, English and Japanese.
